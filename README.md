My solutions to Project Eulers problems https://projecteuler.net/

For my solutions in Python, I typically use Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook, which utilizes Python 3. 

I also try to use as many of my own functions as possible. This includes creating my own code for checking whether a number is prime (is_prime(n)) and listing all the primes below an inputted number (listofprimes(n)) instead of using python's sympy built in fucntions: isprime() and primepi(n).

## Solutions so far:
3, 9, 10, 39, 47, and 50.

## Directory of my functions:
is_prime(n): checks whether a number is prime or not. TRUE or FALSE.

listofprimes(n): lists all the primes below an inputted number. Outputs a number.
