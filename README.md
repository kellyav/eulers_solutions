My solutions to Project Eulers problems https://projecteuler.net/

For my solutions in Python, I typically use Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook, which utilizes Python 3. I also try to use as many of my own functions as possible. This includes creating my own code for checking whether a number is prime (is_prime(n)) and listing all the primes below an inputted number (listofprimes(n)) instead of using python's sympy built in fucntions: isprime() and primepi(n).
